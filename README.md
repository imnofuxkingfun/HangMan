# Hangman Game

## Description
This is a Hangman game implemented in both Python and C++. The game features three categories of words:
- Supernatural Entities
- Astronomy
- Colors

Each category contains ten difficult words for an extra challenge. The game includes visual representations of the hangman at each stage, cool displays for winning and losing, and error handling for duplicate and invalid inputs.

## How to Play
1. One of the three categories will be randomly chosen and displayed at the start.
2. Guess letters one by one.
3. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
4. If the letter is incorrect, the hangman visual updates with a new mistake / new body part.
5. The game ends when either the word is guessed correctly or the hangman is fully drawn (equivalent of 6 mistakes).
